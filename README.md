# AR-Environment-Skeleton

You can use this repo to build new Activerecord projects

* You will need to create your own app/models directories

Make all necessary changes to satisfy these deliverables: 
- A Student has many Teachers through GradeLevel
- A Teacher has many Students through GradeLevel
You should have a complete seeds file 
Answer the following questions:
- What changes did you make to your app? Why? 
Think of an additional relationship (for ex: Student has many books, Books have many Students…no you can’t use this example). Write down deliverables for that relationship (what attributes? What class methods? What instance methods?) and then implement them.
Once you have finished this, You will be doing code reviews with each other.
Discuss/Answer the following questions: 
What was the most difficult part of this challenge for you? 
Review each other's changes for the many to many. Are there any differences in how you solved the problem? Differences in how you wrote the methods? Differences in your schema? Any missed opportunities to use helper methods? If so, discuss it with each other. Explain your decisions and be open to any feedback your partner has on how your code could be improved (if any) 
Review your answers to all of the questions. Any differences? 
How did you handle `grade_level`? Did you leave it as an attribute on Student? Why? Why not?
